            ## User Story

            AS A web developer

            I WANT a deployed portfolio

            SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients

            ## Business Context

            A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

            ## Acceptance Criteria

            GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

            WHEN viewing their portfolio

            THEN they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories

        <!-- Content here -->
            <p> As a self-taught web developer, I never went through any formal schooling for programming or
                development. While being self-taught takes tenacity and hard work, it left me with some gaps in
                knowledge. That was when I decided to enroll in this web development bootcamp.
            </p>

            <p> Before attending the bootcamp, I had experience with HTML, CSS, Python (particularly the Django
                framework) and some JavaScript. Throughout the bootcamp I picked up a lot of more JavaScript, in
                addition to Node.JS.
            </p>

            <p> As someone who comes from a content background and someone who lived a life as a past journalist, web
                development offers an interesting pivot as I have seen the tech industry from the shoes of other roles.
                I landed on pivoting my career to being a fulltime dev.
            </p>

            <p> I'm going to write about myself instead of my turtle.
