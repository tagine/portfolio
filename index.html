            <!--Portfolio narrative

                ## User Story

                AS A web developer

                I WANT a deployed portfolio

                SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients

                ## Business Context

                A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

                ## Acceptance Criteria

                GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

                WHEN viewing their portfolio

                THEN they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories

            <p> I’m a Web Developer with interests in well-designed user-centered projects. I have a passion for
                accessibility and would love to work on more projects that include it as a core tenet. I built my first
                website when I was ten years old, it was for a local band. Finding out about the right-click and view
                source feature in Mozilla Firefox changed my life back then. I still find myself right-clicking these
                days, but mostly to inspect different elements. My interest in actively learning about Web Development
                was renewed with my fellowship with Interactive Mechanics ('17-'18).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently enrolled in the Penn LPS Web Development programming bootcamp, where I'm learning how to
                become a fullstack developer and getting a lot of hands-on practice with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
                jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize.css, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and
                Git.
            </p>

            <p> As a former journalist, I have a background in content strategy. As someone who has been running their own business and contracting for years, I am now looking for a
                fulltime web development position. I am also interested in contributing to more open source projects. My
                only contribution so far is for Peregrine, a Django-based CMS that uses Wagtail as a framework. I added
                a minor contribution of a footer to the project.
            </p>

            <p> I live in Philadelphia, with my pet-turtle, Murphy Brown, Jr. But we’re both willing to relocate for the
                right opportunity.
            </p>
